## Hey there!

I'm Matt Kinnersley.

I'm starting this blog to give me something to do during the current COVID-19 crisis. It will serve as a way for me to document my learning and as a resource for others. I am by no means an expert but I am hoping through this blog, I can help someone with a problem they are stuck on. Maybe that's with something like a tutorial or maybe just an update with what I learned that day.

## Who am I?

I'm a Software Developer by trade and by hobby. I will be looking at technology in all sorts of forms but primarily I focus on web development. I write code daily for work and for any one of my many unfinished side projects.

If you are anything like me and you want to keep improving your skills, consider following me on twitter [@techwaffler](https://www.twitter.com/techwaffler) for updates on this blog.

I'll try to keep this blog updated atleast biweekly, so keep an eye out.

For now, I'll keep this one short and I hope I'll see you again soon.
